# Python Algorithms Collection

Explore a range of powerful algorithms implemented in Python 3.12.6. This repository includes efficient solutions for key algorithmic challenges, focusing on recursion, backtracking, and number theory.

## 📚 Algorithms Included

### 1. **Recursion & Backtracking**
- 🔗 [Recursive Functions](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/tree/recursive)  
  Dive into a series of recursive function implementations that solve common algorithmic problems through recursion.

- 🔗 [Prime Numbers](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/blob/base/base.py)  
  Efficient methods to identify prime numbers, leveraging number theory and recursion.

- 🔗 [Palindrome Partitioning](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/tree/palindrome.partitioning)  
  Solve the palindrome partitioning problem using backtracking techniques. Break a string into all possible palindromic partitions.

- 🔗 [Merge Array](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/blob/merge-array/merge-array.py) ([LeetCode 88](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/submissions/1526158540))  
    Python solution for merging two sorted arrays in-place. The algorithm runs in `O(m + n)` time complexity and uses `O(1)` extra space.
