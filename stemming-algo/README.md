# Stemming Algo

**Stemming** is an important text-processing technique that reduces words to their base or root form by removing prefixes and suffixes. This process standardizes words which helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various **natural language processing (NLP)** tasks.

It helps in tasks such as **text classification**, **information retrieval** and **text summarization** by reducing words to a base form. While it is effective, it can sometimes introduce drawbacks including potential inaccuracies and a reduction in text readability.

Examples of stemming for the word "like":

  - "likes" → "like"
  - "liked" → "like"
  - "likely" → "like"
  - "liking" → "like"
